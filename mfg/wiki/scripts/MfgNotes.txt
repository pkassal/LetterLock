Notes on how to use scripts to produce files for the Japanese puzzle.

At present all the paths are hard coded. I've added an item to my ToDo list to
feel bad about this.

The process starts with a file names wikistart.htm, which is a downloaded 
version of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_popular_pages_by_WikiProject.

teasepopularpages.pl - Extracts lists of popular pages from wikistart.htm, producing wikiwant.txt

teasepagebypage.pl - Gets individual popular pages for each wikiwant.txt entry and saves out misc data for each popular page.

filterwikicands.pl - Filters out individual popular pages from teasepagebypage.pl based on miscellaneous attributes. End result is wikixmlpicks.txt

Next: sort -rn -k 4 wikixmlpicks.txt > wikixmlpicks.sort

GetXmlPages.pl - Brings down wikipedia web pages of interest based on popularity and stores in sets. wikixmlpicks.sort -> xml1/set

TeaseAllFromXml1.pl - Loops over a set of wikipedia XML directories and calls teasefromxml1.pl for each

teasefromxml1.pl - Takes a gzipped xml file from wikipedia/GetXmlPages.pl and extracts phrases of interest using a very simple method, writing separate output files for each popular page.

WriteFinalDataSetJapanese1.pl - Makes final file directory structure. Maybe Paul makes new derived info from here. This also does random sampling to limit the overall output size. This could be undone if needed.

Config files: 
catmap.txt - semi-auto file with mapping from categories to puzzle categories (or delete)
linkstops.txt - stop list of common unuseful links, based on frequency review.
classnames.txt - simple name map from internal to display names

makecategorymap.pl - makes catmap.txt config file. 
catwords.map - hand-tagged file mapping key words to categories
stats1.cats - collected-up list of unique categories
